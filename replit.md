## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client is a modern React-based Single-Page Application (SPA) using TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. It leverages Radix UI components with shadcn/ui for an accessible design system, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Vite is used for fast development and optimized builds, adhering to a component-based architecture with shared UI components, custom hooks, and context providers.

### Backend Architecture
The server implements a RESTful API using Express.js with TypeScript. It follows a layered architecture, abstracting routes and storage. API endpoints are organized by resource, and the system includes centralized error handling and JSON body parsing. An interface-based storage abstraction ensures flexible data layer implementations.

### Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The relational schema includes tables for users, categories, assets, dictionary entries, and activities, with proper indexing and foreign key relationships. Drizzle Kit is used for schema migrations.

### Authentication & Authorization
A basic user system is implemented with user profiles and session management via Express sessions, stored in PostgreSQL. The architecture is designed to be extensible for future authentication mechanisms.

### State Management Strategy
A hybrid approach combines TanStack Query for server state caching and synchronization, React Context for client-side UI state (e.g., user preferences, sidebar), and Local Storage for persistent UI preferences. IndexedDB provides offline data caching and pending action queuing, supporting an offline-first strategy.

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Features
The application includes comprehensive PWA capabilities: an advanced Service Worker for static asset and API response caching, full offline functionality, native-like installation, and background sync for offline actions. Intelligent cache invalidation and real-time network status monitoring are also implemented.

### Data Import/Export System
The platform offers robust data management with JSON and CSV export functionality. A file-based import system supports bulk asset creation, featuring Zod schema validation for data integrity and detailed error reporting.
