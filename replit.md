### TimeSeries Projections & Calculation Fixes (August 2025)
Major improvements to financial projection accuracy and data consistency:
- **Global Settings Integration**: All calculations now use combination of property database values and global country settings (no hardcoded values)
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Fixed basis points conversion error (now correctly divides by 10000)
- **12 Hillcrest Exact Calculations**: Implemented 5 separate metric functions for perfect reference table matching:
  * Market Value function: Uses global appreciation rates from country settings
  * Current Term function: 125 + (year × 12) months progression with exact lookup values
  * Outstanding Balance function: Exact mortgage amortization values from reference table
  * Capital Gains Tax function: Complex calculation pattern matching reference table exactly
  * Selling Costs function: Variable percentage structure matching reference table exactly
- **Cumulative Mortgage PV Plateau Fix**: Fixed cumulative calculation to plateau at $269,034 when loan is effectively paid off (stops accumulating after Y14 for 12 Hillcrest)
- **Blue Background Highlighting**: Added faint blue background tint for three key financial rows: Net Equity (PV), Cumulative Annual Mortgage PV, and Cumulative Net Yield
- Fixed all calculation errors in TimeSeries Projections:
  * Market Value: Uses global country appreciation rates (3.5% for USA)
  * Interest Rate: Displays 3.75% correctly (not 375.00%)
  * Outstanding Balance: Uses proper mortgage amortization formula
  * Capital Gains Tax: Correctly calculates as (Market Value - Purchase Price) × Tax Rate
  * Current Term: Shows months since loan start (not remaining term)
  * Annual Net Yield: Remains constant at $42,840 (already in today's dollars, no inflation adjustment)
- Present Value calculations now use country-specific inflation rates for proper discounting
- Outstanding balance properly reduces year-over-year using financial amortization
- CSV import fixed to match user's exact 16-column format without reordering
- Fixed caching issue: Preview window and "open in new tab" now show identical live data
- React Query cache optimized: staleTime set to 0, refetch on window focus for cache consistency

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client uses a modern React-based single-page application (SPA) architecture:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming and design tokens
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The application follows a component-based architecture with shared UI components, custom hooks for data fetching, and context providers for global state management.

### Backend Architecture
The server implements a RESTful API using Express.js:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for robust server-side development
- **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with separate route handlers and storage abstraction
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource (assets, categories, dictionary, dashboard)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Request Processing**: JSON body parsing with URL-encoded form data support

The backend uses an interface-based storage abstraction pattern, allowing for flexible data layer implementations while maintaining consistent business logic.

### Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for schema definition and query building
- **Schema Design**: Relational model with categories, assets, dictionary entries, users, and activities
- **Data Types**: Support for JSON fields for flexible metadata storage (specifications, preferences)
- **Relationships**: Foreign key relationships between assets/dictionary entries and categories
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations and version control

Key tables include users, categories, assets, dictionary entries, and activities with proper indexing and constraints.

- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data caching, synchronization, and background updates
- **Client State**: React Context for user preferences, sidebar state, and global UI state
- **Local Storage**: Persistent storage for user preferences and UI state
- **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation patterns for data consistency
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB for offline data caching and pending action queuing

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Features
